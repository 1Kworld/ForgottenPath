Python Pygame Image Manipulation

This program was created for an image manipulation and reformation project that required using the tools and functions of pygame.
With an open ended prompt, I had two objectives for this project. 

1. Create a program that creates an infinite amount of images
2. Convey the properties of 'pixels' within digitialized images

To accomplish the first objective I used the pygame random function in a multitude of ways:
  - selects a random file to reform 
  - selects the x and y cordinate of the original image to extrapulate pixel information
  - selects the placement of the canvas to place subsections
  
  All of these defintions of my program allows there to be cohesion of each final product, while leaving close to 0% possibility of recreating the same reformed image.

Using my second objective to draw inspiration for my project, I viewed digital image manipulation as just a rearrangment, addition, or reduction of pixels. This project captures these law of image reformation in a creative yet elementary way.

Ultimately I added and leave room for users to add their own found images to create even more infinite amounts of images.
